<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 Employee Management System <a name="about-project"></a>

**Employee Management System** is a project developed in C/C++ using Borland Graphics for the user interface (UI) with the assistance of Turbo C/C++ Windows software. Created in 2017 as my first project and using C/C++ as my initial programming language, this system incorporates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for efficient employee management.

The system boasts visually appealing and user-friendly graphics, demonstrating my proficiency in graphical design. As a test of my graphic skills, I included a "Taj Mahal" design using Borland Graphics as a Thank You page, enhancing the project's aesthetic appeal.

To ensure data security, the project features a robust security barrier, safeguarding sensitive employee information from unauthorized access. The system provides a comprehensive set of functionalities, enabling users to create, view, update, and delete employee records with ease.

This project showcases my early programming abilities, including my dedication and hard work in delivering a fully functional Employee Management System with an intuitive UI, impressive graphics, and necessary security measures.
